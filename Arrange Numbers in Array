You have been given an empty array(ARR) and its size N. The only input taken from the user will be N and you need not worry about the array.
Your task is to populate the array using the integer values in the range 1 to N(both inclusive) in the order - 1,3,.......4,2.
Note:
You need not print the array. You only need to populate it.


public class Solution {
    
    public static void arrange(int[] arr, int n) {
    	//Your code goes here
        int s=0;
        int e=(arr.length)-1;
        int val=1;
        while(s<e)
        {
            arr[s++]=val;
            val++;
            arr[e--]=val;
            val++;
        }
        if(s==e){
            arr[s]=n;
        }
    }
}
